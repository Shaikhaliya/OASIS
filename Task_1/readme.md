🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Task 1

Oasis Infobyte – Data Science Internship

This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:

Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica


using four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

📂 Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with no missing values.
It includes 4 numerical features and 1 target label (species).

🛠 Libraries Used

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

🚀 Project Steps

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Visualized relationships using pairplot, heatmap, and scatter plots
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a classification model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
5. Evaluated accuracy and made predictions


📊 Result

The model achieved high accuracy and correctly classified most Iris flower species.

📝 Conclusion

This project helped understand basic ML steps like data exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
